NOFO announces the availability of funding for EDA's FY 2023 University Center Economic Development Program Competition. This program funds technical assistance provided by an accredited institution of higher education or a consortium of accredited institutions of higher education that is focused on one or more of the following program focus areas: advancing regional commercialization efforts, advancing high-growth entrepreneurship, cultivating innovation, encouraging business expansion in a region's innovation cluster(s), developing a high-skilled regional workforce, and increasing the resilience of a region. EDA solicits competitive applications from accredited institutions of higher education and from consortia of accredited institutions of higher education that are located in and have programs targeting only geographic areas served by EDA's Austin and Denver Regional Offices: Austin Regional Office Serves: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas Denver Regional Office (separate posting for applicants applying from within the Denver Regional Office) Serves: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming EDA recognizes that institutions of higher education are critical players in the development of vibrant economic ecosystems. Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high-speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally-owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Universities have also been leaders in addressing impacts of climate change on regional economic ecosystems and helping to facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. Through this NOFO EDA intends to advance university-based support for economic development in accordance with EDA's investment priorities, but also to pursue, where practicable, certain specific priorities related to equity, workforce development, and climate change resiliency so that investments can benefit everyone for decades to come. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship, resiliency and inclusiveness. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners, such as Economic Development Districts (EDDs) by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement, and support regional strategies that result in quality job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters. Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, workforce training programs, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. EDA encourages efforts to reach historically underserved populations and areas, communities of color, women, and other groups facing labor market barriers such as persons with disabilities, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery, individuals with past criminal records, including justice-impacted and reentry participants, individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and veterans and military spouses, and underserved communities within geographies that have been systemically and\/or systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic prosperity such as Tribal Lands, Persistent Poverty Counties, and rural areas with demonstrated, historical underservice. Submitting an application: EDA is excited to announce its new grants management platform: the Economic Development Grants Experience (EDGE). EDGE was developed to streamline the application and grants management process by implementing a single platform with increased transparency, improved user experience, higher data quality, and more efficiency throughout the entire grant lifecycle.

Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high-speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally-owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Universities have also been leaders in addressing impacts of climate change on regional economic ecosystems and helping to facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. Through this NOFO EDA intends to advance university-based support for economic development in accordance with EDA's investment priorities, but also to pursue, where practicable, certain specific priorities related to equity, workforce development, and climate change resiliency so that investments can benefit everyone for decades to come. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship, resiliency and inclusiveness. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners, such as Economic Development Districts (EDDs) by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement, and support regional strategies that result in quality job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters. Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, workforce training programs, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. EDA encourages efforts to reach historically underserved populations and areas, communities of color, women, and other groups facing labor market barriers such as persons with disabilities, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery, individuals with past criminal records, including justice-impacted and reentry participants, individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and veterans and military spouses, and underserved communities within geographies that have been systemically and\/or systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic prosperity such as Tribal Lands, Persistent Poverty Counties, and rural areas with demonstrated, historical underservice.

The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector. Innovation is the key to greater productivity and global competitiveness, resulting in the creation of new and better jobs, a more resilient economy and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery and advancement because regions encompass the centers of growth and competition in the new global economy. Regions achieve greater results because of the presence of diverse economic agents and, more often than not, clusters of services and industry. Quite simply, regions that work together will fare better than those that do not. Infusing more innovation and collaboration into America's regions has the potential to help communities create and retain higher-wage and sustainable jobs, leverage the flow of private capital, and strengthen America's ability to compete in the global marketplace. EDA recognizes that institutions of higher education are critical players in the development of vibrant economic ecosystems. Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Research also shows that small businesses located in proximity to an institution of higher education tend to be more innovative. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Additionally, universities facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement and support regional strategies which result in job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters . Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. Since FY 2004, EDA has administered the University Center program as a competitive multi year program. As presented in the table below, EDA holds University Center program competitions in two of its six regional offices each of the following fiscal years. In FY 2017, EDA is holding the competition in its Atlanta and Seattle Regional Offices. ","80":"EDA's mission is to lead the Federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for economic growth and success in the worldwide economy. EDA fulfills this mission through strategic investments and partnerships that create the conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life by expanding the capacity of individuals, firms, and communities to maximize the use of their talents and skills to support innovation, lower transaction costs, and responsibly produce and trade valuable goods and services. The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector. Innovation is the key to greater productivity and global competitiveness, resulting in the creation of new and better jobs, a more resilient economy and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery and advancement because regions encompass the centers of growth and competition in the new global economy. Regions achieve greater results because of the presence of diverse economic agents and, more often than not, clusters of services and industry. Quite simply, regions that work together will fare better than those that do not. Infusing more innovation and collaboration into America's regions has the potential to help communities create and retain higher-wage and sustainable jobs, leverage the flow of private capital, and strengthen America's ability to compete in the global marketplace. EDA recognizes that institutions of higher education are critical players in the development of vibrant economic ecosystems. Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Research also shows that small businesses located in proximity to an institution of higher education tend to be more innovative. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Additionally, universities facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement and support regional strategies which result in job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters .

","83":"NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration & Research (OER) seeks to enhance ocean exploration and scientific knowledge of the unknown or poorly known areas of the ocean. This entails identifying, describing and creating baseline characterizations of new ocean habitats, marine resources and\/or processes. In this Announcement, OER is seeking proposals focused on four themes: 1. Exploration of physical, chemical and biological environments and processes within the oceanic water column below ~200m; 2. Exploration of geological, physical, and biological environments as well as biogeochemical processes associated with seamounts; 3. Novel or innovative technologies and methodologies that could increase the pace and scope of ocean exploration, especially exploration of the water column, seamounts, and archaeological sites; and 4. Proposals focused on the discovery and exploration of historically significant submerged marine heritage sites, features and artifacts associated with WWII. Proposals that combine more than one of these exploration themes are encouraged. OER's overarching objective is to investigate and document poorly known and unknown ocean areas through interdisciplinary exploration, and to advance and disseminate knowledge of the ocean's physical, geological, chemical, biological, and archaeological environments. Findings from projects and expeditions are anticipated to result in new baseline characterizations; provide better scientific understanding of the processes on U.S. continental margins and the deep ocean; offer new insights into climate variability and marine ecosystems; reveal new or unconventional energy, mineral, biological, and archaeological resources; help identify hazards resulting from extreme events such as submarine volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis; and deliver technology advancements (platforms, sensors, methodologies, etc.) that will increase observational capabilities in the ocean. OER is interested in characterization of seamounts located within regions of the U.S. EEZ or ECS, including the Gulf of Alaska, the NW Atlantic, and the deep regions of Marine Protected Areas. Characterization of physical, chemical, and biological ocean environments associated with seamounts in areas where ocean mining may occur (e.g., regions along the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture) is also of particular interest.

Recognizable climate patterns, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), emerge at the regional level where our understanding of observations and models coalesce. Critical resources for society are managed in a context of regional systems, such as water supply and human populations. Multiple scales of governance (local, state, and federal) with complex institutional relationships can be examined across a region. Climate information (i.e. data, science, research etc) developed within these contexts and working across spatial and temporal scales resonates with people making decisions on the ground.Recognizing the importance of regions and the interests of Congress, the President's Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (ICCATF) recommends that regional climate science and service efforts of the Federal government should be better coordinated to most effectively support regional-to-local decision makers facing the impacts of climate change. Congress and the Administration want to ensure that trust between scientists and decision makers who are already working to manage climate risks is not compromised by duplicative or conflicting information. The NOAA Climate Program Office's (CPO) Regionally Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) program supports research teams that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, user-inspired, and regionally relevant research that informs resource management and public policy. The eleven RISA teams are nationally and internationally recognized for their innovations in providing support to decision makers on the ground who are managing risks associated with climate variability and change. NOAA's RISA program is a part of CPO's Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI) division and an active partner in the National Climate Data Center's (NCDC) efforts to build an integrated regional climate services partnership.Central to the RISA approach are commitments to process, partnership, and trust building; assessments of stakeholder decision-making needs and contexts; and evaluation of institutional and political constraints to using climate knowledge. RISA teams are effective because they have been able to create strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including local, regional, and state governments, federal agencies, tribal governments, utilities, the business community, national and international non-profit organizations, and educational institutions.After 15 years of regional capacity building and research, a key finding from the RISA program is that trust building between partners is best accomplished when using shared resources to collaborate on common goals, objectives or outcomes. Working together to solve problems brings people together to innovate lasting solutions. Furthermore, capacity (tools, information, knowledge, etc) is best sustained when the developers of capability or knowledge are working hand-in-hand with those entities who will apply that capability or knowledge over time. This announcement is designed to stimulate partnerships by bringing people together around specific projects related to regionally relevant issues addressing climate adaptation.

","189":"NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals for ocean exploration-related projects under three themes. By supporting exploration, i.e., discovery through disciplined, diverse observations, NOAA Ocean Exploration seeks to advance our basic understanding of waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Projects under the ocean exploration and discovery and technology themes are restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction and should support national priorities such as those in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/NOMEC_OEC_Priorities_Report.pdf) developed per the National Strategy for Mapping, Exploring, and Characterizing the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/nomec). Projects under the maritime heritage theme are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction. All projects should support at least one of NOAA's science and technology priorities of uncrewed systems, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 'omics, data, and citizen science (https:\/\/sciencecouncil.noaa.gov\/NOAA-Science-Technology-Focus-Areas). For Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) funding, NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals focused on any one of the following three themes: OCEAN EXPLORATION and DISCOVERY: Proposals should be in support of the NOAA Ocean Exploration mission to explore unknown or poorly known ocean areas, processes, and resources in waters deeper than 200 meters. Thus, NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in exploration of physical, chemical, and biological environments and processes within the oceanic water column in these deep waters. However, proposals for projects in shallower waters will be considered if they focus on exploration of tropical mesophotic environments. All proposals should be for work within waters under U.S. jurisdiction and describe how the work will address the thematic and geographic priorities for ocean exploration in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.TECHNOLOGY: Proposals should feature application of new or novel use of existing ocean technologies or innovative methods that could increase the scope and efficiency of acquiring ocean exploration data and expanding its availability and use. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in proposals for technologies that are platform agnostic (work across multiple platforms) and\/or address novel methods (for example machine learning and artificial intelligence) to analyze existing publicly accessible large datasets. Proposed ocean technologies must be applicable to water depths of 200 meters or greater, preferably full-ocean depth (testing in shallower water or lab-based testing is acceptable), address at least one of the defined ocean exploration variables as referenced in the \"Exploration Variables Identified by NOAA Ocean Exploration\" technical memorandum (https:\/\/repository.library.noaa.gov\/view\/noaa\/29495), and describe how the work will address the thematic and geographic priorities for ocean exploration in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.MARITIME HERITAGE: Proposals should address exploration and discovery of significant maritime heritage resources that improve archaeological knowledge and inform decisions concerning preservation, management, and potential seafloor use. Maritime heritage projects can be conducted in any water depth, can focus on prehistoric and historic-period subjects, and are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Data products must benefit other academic and resource management disciplines. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in proposals that include the use of innovative and advanced technology and methodology.

","348":"The NOAA B-WET Program is an environmental education program that supports outdoor, experiential learning through competitive grant awards in specific geographic regions. Prior to 2008, NOAA B-WET Programs were established for the Chesapeake Bay and Monterey, CA areas, and the Hawaiian Islands. In 2008 three new programs began, in New England, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Northwest. We anticipate that funds for new and continuing projects will be available under the New England B-WET program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Proposals are currently being solicited for the New England B- WET program under this funding opportunity. For the purposes of this solicitation, the New England region is defined as the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, are essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Successful projects are those carefully selected place-based experiences that are driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery, wonder, and associated stewardship impulses. B-WET projects nurture a sense of community, enable students to understand their place in their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. Experiential learning techniques, such as those supported by the NOAA B-WET Program, have been shown to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This funding opportunity supports K-12 environmental education programs that provide students with meaningful watershed education experiences (MWEEs), and provide related professional development and support to in-service teachers, administrators, or other educators serving K-12 students in New England. The Atlantic Ocean and its bays, and tidal and non-tidal rivers and tributaries are an excellent resource for environmental education. These waterbodies and the surrounding landscape provide hands-on, place-based laboratories where students can see, touch, and learn about watersheds and the greater environment. For purposes of this solicitation, MWEEs are defined as below: - Experiences are investigative or project oriented. They center around questions, problems, and issues investigated through data collection, observation, and hands-on activities. Experiences stimulate observation, motivate critical thinking, develop problem-solving skills, and instill confidence in students. Where age and experience-appropriate, technology such as probeware, tablets, and GPS equipment should be integrated throughout the instructional process. Experiences such as tours, gallery visits, simulations, demonstrations, or nature walks may be instructionally useful but alone do not constitute a meaningful experience. - Experiences are an integral part of the instructional program and clearly part of what is occurring concurrently in the classroom. The experience should be part of the curriculum and align with the academic standards. They should occur where and when they fit into the instructional sequence. - Experiences do not have to be based solely on scientific disciplines. They may involve materials, resources, and instruments that address multiple topics, such as maritime heritage, history, economics, civic, math, English, art, and the cultural significance of our natural resources. They should make appropriate connections between subject areas and reflect an integrated approach to learning. - Meaningful experiences are part of a sustained activity that stimulates and motivates the student from beginning to end. Though a watershed experience itself may occur as one specific event on one day, the total duration leading up to and following the experience should involve a significant investment of instructional time. Each experience should consist of three general phases: preparation; action; and reflection. Projects should provide teachers with the support, materials, resources, and information they need to conduct these three phases. \u2022 The preparation phase should focus on a question, problem, or issue and involve students in discussions about it. \u2022 The action phase should include multiple outdoor experiences sufficient to conduct the project, make the observations, or collect the data required. We strongly encourage an action phase that includes both investigation and restoration or stewardship projects that improve the environment. \u2022 The reflection phase should refocus on the question, problem, or issue; analyze the conclusions reached; evaluate the results; assess the activity and the knowledge gained; and include sharing and communication of the results. - Experiences consider the watershed as a system. MWEEs should make a direct connection to the marine or estuarine environment. Experiences do not have to be water-based activities as long as an intentional connection is made to the watershed, water quality, and the coastal and marine environment. Watershed experiences may include terrestrial activities (e.g., erosion control, buffer creation, groundwater protection, pollution monitoring or prevention). - NOAA products, services, or personnel enhance these experiences. NOAA can increase the impact of outdoor experiences with its wealth of applicable products and services, and cadre of scientific and professional experts. For example, NOAA data can supplement or contextualize the information collected by students. NOAA personnel have technical knowledge and experience that can serve to complement the classroom teacher's strengths and augment the array of resources for education. The inclusion of NOAA products and services in classroom activities will increase awareness of the agency's vast natural, informational, and data resources and may lead to better understanding of its mission. Additionally, these professionals can serve as important role models for career choices and as natural resources stewards, thus promoting STEM careers.","349":"States play an essential role in conserving and recovering species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Listed species under NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) jurisdiction may spend all or part of their life-cycles in state waters, and success in conserving these species depends largely on working cooperatively with the States. NMFS is authorized to provide Federal assistance to eligible State agencies to support the development and implementation of conservation programs for listed marine and anadromous species that reside within that State. This assistance, provided in the form of grants through the Species Recovery Grants to States Program, can be used to support conservation activities for endangered and threatened species, as well as monitoring of candidate species, recently delisted species, and species proposed for listing under the ESA. Funded activities may include development and implementation of management efforts, scientific research, and public education and outreach.

NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today's variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow's. Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development. These investments are key to NOAA's mission of \"Science, Service, and Stewardship\" and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) . Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts - is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA's five-year climate objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with Federal, academic, private, and international research entities, and places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders.Within this context, NOAA's Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs conducted in regions across the United States, at national and international scales, and globally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance and oversight for the agency's climate science and services programs and helps to integrate capabilities from across the agency to provide enhanced services to its constituents.

The underlying focus of the MMPA is the implementation of policies to prevent the decline of marine mammal species beyond the point where they would stop being functioning parts of their ecosystems. The MMPA prohibits the taking of any marine mammal in U.S. waters, with the exception of certain cases such as through permitted activities, where \"take\" is defined as hunting, harassing, capturing, or killing a marine mammal or attempting to do so. The MMPA is unique in that its underlying intent is the management of marine mammal stocks to help them achieve their optimum sustainable populations within their ecosystems, rather than managing for the benefit of commercial exploitation. The MMPA was amended in 1994 to provide certain exceptions to the take prohibitions, establish provisions for the preparation of marine mammal stock assessment reports, implement a program addressing interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals, and institute studies of pinniped interactions with fisheries. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is charged with carrying out the mandates of the MMPA for the protection of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with protecting walruses, manatees, otters, and polar bears. The Marine Mammal Program within the NMFS Northeast Region's Protected Resources Division (PRD) carries out the mandates of the MMPA, and is charged with protecting the whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals that occur within the Northeast region (Maine through Virginia). Many of the program's activities focus on addressing human-caused impacts to marine mammals, including vessel strikes and fishing gear interactions, and managing behaviors associated with marine mammal viewing activities, such as whale watches and recreational boating.

","428":"The California B-WET grant program is a competitively based program that supports existing environmental education programs, fosters the growth of new programs, and encourages the development of partnerships among environmental education programs throughout the San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, and Santa Barbara Channel watersheds. Projects support organizations that provide students ``meaningful'' watershed educational experiences and teachers professional development opportunities in the area of environmental education. ","429":"NOAA's Office of Education (OEd), Educational Partnership Program (EPP) with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) solicits applications from accredited postsecondary MSIs to establish five NOAA Cooperative Science Centers (CSCs). These five CSCs are designed to create collaborative partnerships among MSIs and NOAA's Line Offices. NOAA's mission as stated in the FY2009-2014 NOAA Strategic Plan, is ``[t]o understand and predict changes in Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social, and environmental needs.'' The Uniform Resource Locator for NOAA Strategic Planning is http:\/\/ www.ppi.noaa.gov\/strategic_planning.html. Additional information about NOAA may be found on the Web site: http:\/\/www.noaa.gov. Each NOAA Cooperative Science Center must conduct education and research that directly supports NOAA's mission. The purpose of these CSCs at MSIs is to: (1) Educate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields related to the CSCs' research areas to increase the number and diversity of NOAA's and the nation's STEM workforce; (2) conduct research in collaboration with NOAA scientists and engineers to better understand the significance of changes in the Earth's oceans, coasts, Great Lakes, weather and climate; and, (3) build capacity and sustainability in NOAA-relevant STEM areas at all center institutions. The CSCs are to leverage existing education and research program capabilities to train and graduate students in NOAA- mission STEM fields including broader disciplines (e.g., economics and social sciences). The CSCs are to build sustainable capacity, maintaining newly established curricula, as well as upgraded research facilities that will enhance their ability to conduct NOAA education and research that contributes to a pipeline of students trained in STEM fields. The EPP is designed to enhance capacity at MSIs that educate, train, and graduate students in STEM fields and to increase environmental literacy by establishing partnerships with academia, the private sector, and other state, tribal and local agencies. Additional program details may be found on the Web site: http:\/\/www.epp.noaa.gov. Interested applicants should be responsive to both the notice in the Federal Register and the Federal Funding Opportunity (FFO) announcement. A PDF version of both the Federal Register Notice and the FFO are available at http:\/\/www.epp.noaa.gov\/. ","430":"The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) consists of estuarine areas of the United States and its territories which are designated and managed for research and educational purposes. Each Reserve within the system is chosen to reflect regional differences and to include a variety of ecosystem types in accordance with the classification scheme of the national program as presented in 15 CFR part 921. Each Reserve supports a wide range of beneficial uses of ecological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic values which are dependent upon the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem. The sites provide habitats for a wide range of ecologically and commercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Each Reserve has been designed to ensure its effectiveness as a conservation unit and as a site for long- term research and monitoring. As part of a national system, the Reserves collectively provide an excellent opportunity to address research questions and estuarine management issues of national significance.
