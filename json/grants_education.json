The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a vision, mission and a set of strategic goals to build a Climate Ready-Nation. The Climate Program Office (CPO) supports this vision as part of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). A CPO core function is to support extramural research through a competitive grants process. CPO's programs span foundational, cross-disciplinary climate sciences, assessments, capacity building, tool development, and education. CPO collaborates closely with partners within NOAA and with the broader academic, Federal, Tribal nations, international bodies, and private sector community. CPO works in close partnership with the OAR laboratories and programs to complement and support its in-house research. CPO also works with other parts of NOAA to support its mission areas in weather, oceans, fisheries, and service delivery. CPO further builds networks, coalitions, and collaborations, converges around the best ideas, and provides support to accelerate emerging innovation across the climate enterprise. Undertaking a range of climate science and services initiatives, CPO helps our Nation and the world address climate-related challenges and pursue solution-focused opportunities. CPO's definition of climate services is comprehensive, encompassing not only the development and dissemination of actionable climate science to inform decision making, but also the partnerships to engage in and understand the social and policy contexts within which climate-relevant decisions are made. Through this announcement, CPO is seeking applications for six individual competitions in FY24. CPO plays a critical role in advancing science and informing decisions for climate adaptation, resilience, and mitigation as part of NOAA and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. CPO research\/science programs and activities meet urgent climate challenges, and incubate innovative advancements in Earth system and social sciences; support world-class assessment reports, including the National Climate Assessment; enhance and expand NOAA's capabilities for integrated information systems for drought, heat and floods to deliver timely science-based information that can reduce the impacts and costs of these climate-driven challenges; educate and grow the next generation of experts in support of NOAA's climate mission. Through these new investments, CPO expands previous efforts focused on climate risks to address a suite of urgent climate-driven societal challenges faced by our Nation - including water availability and quality, marine and freshwater ecosystems, coastal changes and inundation, drought and extreme heat and related cascading hazards like wildfire, and air quality, and climate mitigation (more information about CPO Societal Challenges and Risks framework can be found here: https:\/\/www.cpo.noaa.gov\/Initiatives\/Climate-Risk-Areas-Initiative). NOAA, OAR, and CPO require applicants and awardees to support the principles of diversity and inclusion when writing their proposals and performing their work; indeed, applicants will be evaluated, in part, on how well principles of diversity and inclusion are addressed. Diversity is defined as a collection of individual attributes that together help organizations achieve objectives. Inclusion is defined as a culture that connects each employee to the organization. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the climate research community in which CPO engages.","62805":"NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program (OAP) Education Mini-Grant Program, is a competitively-based initiative that supports coastal and ocean acidification education programs that are responsive to the goals of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Education Implementation Plan and the 2021-2040 NOAA Education Strategic Plan.

CPO's strategy addresses challenges in the areas of: (1) Weather and climate extremes, (2) Climate impacts on water resources, (3) Coasts and climate resilience, (4) Sustainability of marine ecosystems, and (5) Changing atmospheric composition and its impacts. Making progress in addressing climate-related societal challenges, and realizing benefits for NOAA's public and private partners, requires that these mission-focused capabilities be integrated across CPO to align research, applications, transitions, and operations, and to meet the information needs for a resilient society. We work towards this objective of integration through a focus on climate intelligence and climate resilience, in support of NOAA's goals. CPO defines climate intelligence as the capabilities regarding: (1) Observations and monitoring, (2) Earth system science and modeling, (3) Climate and societal interactions, and (4) Communication, education, and engagement. Climate resilience leverages climate intelligence to advance capabilities for responding to the urgent and growing demand for reliable, trusted, transparent, and timely climate information needed to protect and sustain all sectors of our economy and environment. A hallmark of CPO's success in linking climate intelligence to resilience is the development and deployment of end-to-end research-based integrated information systems that address needs of high societal relevance. Key components of this effort are annual Notice of Funding Opportunities, competitive grants programs and other types of support that advance and extend NOAA's foundational capabilities and applications research. Proficiency in these core areas ensures that CPO's infrastructure is always in place to meet the intelligence and resilience challenges of our changing climate. NOAA, OAR, and CPO encourage applicants and awardees to support the principles of diversity and inclusion when writing their proposals and performing their work. Diversity is defined as a collection of individual attributes that together help organizations achieve objectives. Inclusion is defined as a culture that connects each employee to the organization.

CPO also provides strategic guidance for the agency's broader climate science and services programs and supports NOAA's mandated responsibilities under the National Climate Program Act, Global Change Research Act and its National Climate Assessment, the National Integrated Drought Information System Act, and similar international endeavors such as the Global Framework for Climate Services. CPO's climate research portfolio is designed to achieve a fully integrated research and applications program. CPO's strategy addresses challenges in the areas of: (1) Weather and climate extremes, (2) Climate impacts on water resources, (3) Coasts and climate resilience, (4) Sustainability of marine ecosystems, and (5) Changing atmospheric composition and its impacts. Making progress in addressing climate-related societal challenges, and realizing benefits for NOAA's public and private partners, requires that these mission-focused capabilities be integrated across CPO to align research, applications, transitions, and operations, and to meet the information needs for a resilient society. We work towards this objective of integration through a focus on climate intelligence and climate resilience, in support of NOAA's goals. CPO defines climate intelligence as the capabilities regarding: (1) Observations and monitoring, (2) Earth system science and modeling, (3) Climate and societal interactions, and (4) Communication, education, and engagement. Climate resilience leverages climate intelligence to advance capabilities for responding to the urgent and growing demand for reliable, trusted, transparent, and timely climate information needed to protect and sustain all sectors of our economy and environment. A hallmark of CPO's success in linking climate intelligence to resilience is the development and deployment of end-to-end research-based integrated information systems that address needs of high societal relevance. Key components of this effort are annual Federal Funding Opportunities, competitive grants programs and other types of support that advance and extend NOAA's foundational capabilities and applications research. Proficiency in these core areas ensures that CPO's infrastructure is always in place to meet the intelligence and resilience challenges of our changing climate. NOAA, OAR, and CPO encourage applicants and awardees to support the principles of diversity and inclusion when writing their proposals and performing their work. Diversity is defined as a collection of individual attributes that together help organizations achieve objectives. Inclusion is defined as a culture that connects each employee to the organization. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the climate research community in which CPO engages.

EDA fulfills this mission through strategic investments and partnerships that create the conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life by expanding the capacity of individuals, firms, and communities to maximize the use of their talents and skills to support innovation, lower transaction costs, and responsibly produce and trade valuable goods and services. The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector. Innovation is the key to greater productivity and global competitiveness, resulting in the creation of new and better jobs, a more resilient economy and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery and advancement because regions encompass the centers of growth and competition in the new global economy. Regions achieve greater results because of the presence of diverse economic agents and, more often than not, clusters of services and industry. Quite simply, regions that work together will fare better than those that do not. Infusing more innovation and collaboration into America's regions has the potential to help communities create and retain higher-wage and sustainable jobs, leverage the flow of private capital, and strengthen America's ability to compete in the global marketplace. EDA recognizes that institutions of higher education are critical players in the development of vibrant economic ecosystems. Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Research also shows that small businesses located in proximity to an institution of higher education tend to be more innovative. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Additionally, universities facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement and support regional strategies which result in job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters . Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. Since FY 2004, EDA has administered the University Center program as a competitive multi year program. As presented in the table below, EDA holds University Center program competitions in two of its six regional offices each of the following fiscal years. In FY 2017, EDA is holding the competition in its Atlanta and Seattle Regional Offices. ","14644":"EDA's mission is to lead the Federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for economic growth and success in the worldwide economy. EDA fulfills this mission through strategic investments and partnerships that create the conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life by expanding the capacity of individuals, firms, and communities to maximize the use of their talents and skills to support innovation, lower transaction costs, and responsibly produce and trade valuable goods and services. The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector. Innovation is the key to greater productivity and global competitiveness, resulting in the creation of new and better jobs, a more resilient economy and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery and advancement because regions encompass the centers of growth and competition in the new global economy. Regions achieve greater results because of the presence of diverse economic agents and, more often than not, clusters of services and industry. Quite simply, regions that work together will fare better than those that do not. Infusing more innovation and collaboration into America's regions has the potential to help communities create and retain higher-wage and sustainable jobs, leverage the flow of private capital, and strengthen America's ability to compete in the global marketplace.

","73164":"The NOAA B-WET Program is an environmental education program that supports outdoor, experiential learning through competitive grant awards in specific geographic regions. Prior to 2008, NOAA B-WET Programs were established for the Chesapeake Bay and Monterey, CA areas, and the Hawaiian Islands. In 2008 three new programs began, in New England, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Northwest. We anticipate that funds for new and continuing projects will be available under the New England B-WET program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Proposals are currently being solicited for the New England B- WET program under this funding opportunity. For the purposes of this solicitation, the New England region is defined as the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, are essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Successful projects are those carefully selected place-based experiences that are driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery, wonder, and associated stewardship impulses. B-WET projects nurture a sense of community, enable students to understand their place in their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. Experiential learning techniques, such as those supported by the NOAA B-WET Program, have been shown to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This funding opportunity supports K-12 environmental education programs that provide students with meaningful watershed education experiences (MWEEs), and provide related professional development and support to in-service teachers, administrators, or other educators serving K-12 students in New England. The Atlantic Ocean and its bays, and tidal and non-tidal rivers and tributaries are an excellent resource for environmental education. These waterbodies and the surrounding landscape provide hands-on, place-based laboratories where students can see, touch, and learn about watersheds and the greater environment. For purposes of this solicitation, MWEEs are defined as below: - Experiences are investigative or project oriented. They center around questions, problems, and issues investigated through data collection, observation, and hands-on activities. Experiences stimulate observation, motivate critical thinking, develop problem-solving skills, and instill confidence in students. Where age and experience-appropriate, technology such as probeware, tablets, and GPS equipment should be integrated throughout the instructional process. Experiences such as tours, gallery visits, simulations, demonstrations, or nature walks may be instructionally useful but alone do not constitute a meaningful experience. - Experiences are an integral part of the instructional program and clearly part of what is occurring concurrently in the classroom. The experience should be part of the curriculum and align with the academic standards. They should occur where and when they fit into the instructional sequence. - Experiences do not have to be based solely on scientific disciplines. They may involve materials, resources, and instruments that address multiple topics, such as maritime heritage, history, economics, civic, math, English, art, and the cultural significance of our natural resources. They should make appropriate connections between subject areas and reflect an integrated approach to learning. - Meaningful experiences are part of a sustained activity that stimulates and motivates the student from beginning to end. Though a watershed experience itself may occur as one specific event on one day, the total duration leading up to and following the experience should involve a significant investment of instructional time. Each experience should consist of three general phases: preparation; action; and reflection. Projects should provide teachers with the support, materials, resources, and information they need to conduct these three phases. \u2022 The preparation phase should focus on a question, problem, or issue and involve students in discussions about it. \u2022 The action phase should include multiple outdoor experiences sufficient to conduct the project, make the observations, or collect the data required. We strongly encourage an action phase that includes both investigation and restoration or stewardship projects that improve the environment. \u2022 The reflection phase should refocus on the question, problem, or issue; analyze the conclusions reached; evaluate the results; assess the activity and the knowledge gained; and include sharing and communication of the results. - Experiences consider the watershed as a system. MWEEs should make a direct connection to the marine or estuarine environment. Experiences do not have to be water-based activities as long as an intentional connection is made to the watershed, water quality, and the coastal and marine environment. Watershed experiences may include terrestrial activities (e.g., erosion control, buffer creation, groundwater protection, pollution monitoring or prevention). - NOAA products, services, or personnel enhance these experiences. NOAA can increase the impact of outdoor experiences with its wealth of applicable products and services, and cadre of scientific and professional experts. For example, NOAA data can supplement or contextualize the information collected by students. NOAA personnel have technical knowledge and experience that can serve to complement the classroom teacher's strengths and augment the array of resources for education. The inclusion of NOAA products and services in classroom activities will increase awareness of the agency's vast natural, informational, and data resources and may lead to better understanding of its mission. Additionally, these professionals can serve as important role models for career choices and as natural resources stewards, thus promoting STEM careers.","73025":"States play an essential role in conserving and recovering species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Listed species under NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) jurisdiction may spend all or part of their life-cycles in state waters, and success in conserving these species depends largely on working cooperatively with the States. NMFS is authorized to provide Federal assistance to eligible State agencies to support the development and implementation of conservation programs for listed marine and anadromous species that reside within that State. This assistance, provided in the form of grants through the Species Recovery Grants to States Program, can be used to support conservation activities for endangered and threatened species, as well as monitoring of candidate species, recently delisted species, and species proposed for listing under the ESA. Funded activities may include development and implementation of management efforts, scientific research, and public education and outreach. Proposals should address priority actions identified in an ESA Recovery Plan, a State's ESA Section 6 management plan, a State Wildlife Action Plan, or a NMFS-identified regional priority or need. Any State agency that has entered into an agreement with NMFS pursuant to section 6(c) of the ESA within 30 days of the application deadline is eligible to apply under this solicitation.

NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today's variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow's. Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, essential oceanic and atmospheric observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development. These investments are key to NOAA's mission of \"Science, Service, and Stewardship\" and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) . Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts -- is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA's long-term climate goal, with the following objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with all levels of governing structures (e.g., federal, state, tribal, regional, local), academic, private, and international research entities, and it places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders. Within this context, NOAA's Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs through which NOAA funds high-priority climate science, assessments, decision support research, outreach, education, and capacity-building activities designed to advance our understanding of Earth's climate system and to foster the application of this knowledge in risk management and adaptation efforts. The CPO supports research that is conducted across the United States and internationally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance for the agency's climate science and services programs and supports NOAA's contributions to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and its National Climate Assessment and similar international endeavors. In seeking to advance the NGSP climate objective of an improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts, the CPO supports research that advances core capabilities in (a) understanding and modeling, (b) observing systems, data stewardship, and climate monitoring, (c) predictions and projections, and (d) integrated service development and decision support. These core capabilities are, in turn, intended to advance NOAA's ability to provide sustained, reliable, and timely climate services dealing initially, according to the NGSP, with the following broad, societal challenge areas: (a) climate impacts on water resources, (b) vulnerability of coasts and their resilience to climate impacts, (c) sustainability of marine ecosystems, (d) changes in extremes of weather and climate, and (e) information for mitigating climate change. The CPO, therefore, supports research that addresses these societal challenges. ____________ http:\/\/www.ppi.noaa.gov\/ngsp\/ 2 http:\/\/www.ppi.noaa.gov\/ngsp\/","67387":" The principal objective of the Species Recovery Grants to Tribes Program is to support recovery efforts that directly benefit threatened or endangered species, species proposed for listing, de-listed species, or candidate species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS or under the joint jurisdiction of NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

","18300":"Regions have been an organizing influence for both decision makers and scientists working on climate adaptation. Recognizable climate patterns, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), emerge at the regional level where our understanding of observations and models coalesce. Critical resources for society are managed in a context of regional systems, such as water supply and human populations. Multiple scales of governance (local, state, and federal) with complex institutional relationships can be examined across a region. Climate information (i.e. data, science, research etc) developed within these contexts and working across spatial and temporal scales resonates with people making decisions on the ground.Recognizing the importance of regions and the interests of Congress, the President's Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (ICCATF) recommends that regional climate science and service efforts of the Federal government should be better coordinated to most effectively support regional-to-local decision makers facing the impacts of climate change. Congress and the Administration want to ensure that trust between scientists and decision makers who are already working to manage climate risks is not compromised by duplicative or conflicting information. The NOAA Climate Program Office's (CPO) Regionally Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) program supports research teams that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, user-inspired, and regionally relevant research that informs resource management and public policy. The eleven RISA teams are nationally and internationally recognized for their innovations in providing support to decision makers on the ground who are managing risks associated with climate variability and change. NOAA's RISA program is a part of CPO's Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI) division and an active partner in the National Climate Data Center's (NCDC) efforts to build an integrated regional climate services partnership.Central to the RISA approach are commitments to process, partnership, and trust building; assessments of stakeholder decision-making needs and contexts; and evaluation of institutional and political constraints to using climate knowledge. RISA teams are effective because they have been able to create strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including local, regional, and state governments, federal agencies, tribal governments, utilities, the business community, national and international non-profit organizations, and educational institutions.After 15 years of regional capacity building and research, a key finding from the RISA program is that trust building between partners is best accomplished when using shared resources to collaborate on common goals, objectives or outcomes. Working together to solve problems brings people together to innovate lasting solutions. Furthermore, capacity (tools, information, knowledge, etc) is best sustained when the developers of capability or knowledge are working hand-in-hand with those entities who will apply that capability or knowledge over time.

The MMPA prohibits the taking of any marine mammal in U.S. waters, with the exception of certain cases such as through permitted activities, where \"take\" is defined as hunting, harassing, capturing, or killing a marine mammal or attempting to do so. The MMPA is unique in that its underlying intent is the management of marine mammal stocks to help them achieve their optimum sustainable populations within their ecosystems, rather than managing for the benefit of commercial exploitation. The MMPA was amended in 1994 to provide certain exceptions to the take prohibitions, establish provisions for the preparation of marine mammal stock assessment reports, implement a program addressing interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals, and institute studies of pinniped interactions with fisheries. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is charged with carrying out the mandates of the MMPA for the protection of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with protecting walruses, manatees, otters, and polar bears. The Marine Mammal Program within the NMFS Northeast Region's Protected Resources Division (PRD) carries out the mandates of the MMPA, and is charged with protecting the whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals that occur within the Northeast region (Maine through Virginia). Many of the program's activities focus on addressing human-caused impacts to marine mammals, including vessel strikes and fishing gear interactions, and managing behaviors associated with marine mammal viewing activities, such as whale watches and recreational boating. The program also includes a marine mammal health and stranding response component, which includes coordinating response and data collection efforts for stranded animals and learning more about factors affecting the health of marine mammals. Finally, an important component of the Marine Mammal Program is outreach and education efforts to support all of its sub-programs, including regulated parties like fishermen and marine mammal viewing groups like whale watch vessels. For more information about the Marine Mammal Program in the Northeast Region, visit http:\/\/www.nero.noaa.gov\/prot_res\/mmp\/. NMFS seeks the submission of proposals addressing the research and management needs that have been identified for the Marine Mammal Program in the Northeast. A wide variety of applicants are eligible to submit proposals, including state agencies, non-profit organizations, fishermen, stranding network partners, and others. This document describes how to submit proposals for funding in Fiscal Year 2011 and how NMFS will evaluate proposals and determine those that will be recommended for funding.","44782":"The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) recognizes the unique importance of many protected species to tribes and values ongoing efforts by tribal nations to conserve and protect species under NMFS jurisdiction.
