","30098":"There will be eight grant competitions from this notification valued at approximately $16,200,000 as follows: 1) High Impact Weather Testbeds, 2) Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI), 3) Air Quality Research and Forecasting, 4) Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment - Southeast U.S. (VORTEX-SE), 5) Infrasound Detection of Tornadoes and High Impact Weather, 6) Next Generation of Mesoscale Weather Observing Platforms, 7) Snowpack and Soil Moisture Observations and Data Assimilation to Improve the National Water Model (NWM), and 8) Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S). These eight competitions in this notification of funding opportunity reflect multiple science objectives spanning time scales from the very short-term (hours) to seasonal and from weather and water observations and modeling to social and behavioral science. It is focused on improving NOAA's understanding and ultimately its weather and water forecasting services through engagement with the external scientific community on key science gaps of mutual interest through funded grant opportunities. One of the key themes is supporting applied research and development that leads to the demonstration in NOAA's testbeds during the project period of new high impact weather, water, and air quality observing and forecasting applications, including new data or products, improved analysis techniques, better statistical or dynamic forecast models and techniques, and communication of that information to better inform the public. It is expected that NOAA's support of these new capabilities will speed the transition of this new research into operations in order to improve NOAA weather and water services for the public. The subseasonal to seasonal objectives focus on baseline understanding of predictability, advancement of community-driven, NOAA modeling initiatives, and increasing the utility of multi-model ensembles for end users. By facilitating new capabilities on the subseasonal to seasonal range, NOAA seeks to increase resiliency of national infrastructure, support land- and marine-based economic vitality and mitigation efforts, advance month-to-month operational applications, and better position local, regional, and national decision-makers for successful responses to adverse weather events. VORTEX-SE is a NOAA-led effort to understand the aspects of tornadoes in the Southeast U.S. that lead to an increased risk of death and injury in that region. The project emphasizes research, often interdisciplinary in nature, across the spectrum from meteorology to social, behavioral, economic, and engineering sciences. This year's funding opportunity continues the emphases of previous years. Finally, this announcement includes three competitions focused on improving the critical observing system technologies needed to underpin improved forecasts. They are focused on improved snowpack and soil moisture observations, improved mesoscale observations, and innovation in infrasound technology for detection of severe weather. NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) is also announcing a companion Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 federal grant funding opportunity to this OAR opportunity through their Collaborative Science, Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) Program in early October 2018.

Prior to 2008, NOAA B-WET Programs were established for the Chesapeake Bay and Monterey, CA areas, and the Hawaiian Islands. In 2008 three new programs began, in New England, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Northwest. We anticipate that funds for new and continuing projects will be available under the New England B-WET program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Proposals are currently being solicited for the New England B- WET program under this funding opportunity. For the purposes of this solicitation, the New England region is defined as the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, are essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Successful projects are those carefully selected place-based experiences that are driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery, wonder, and associated stewardship impulses. B-WET projects nurture a sense of community, enable students to understand their place in their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. Experiential learning techniques, such as those supported by the NOAA B-WET Program, have been shown to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This funding opportunity supports K-12 environmental education programs that provide students with meaningful watershed education experiences (MWEEs), and provide related professional development and support to in-service teachers, administrators, or other educators serving K-12 students in New England. The Atlantic Ocean and its bays, and tidal and non-tidal rivers and tributaries are an excellent resource for environmental education. These waterbodies and the surrounding landscape provide hands-on, place-based laboratories where students can see, touch, and learn about watersheds and the greater environment. For purposes of this solicitation, MWEEs are defined as below: - Experiences are investigative or project oriented. They center around questions, problems, and issues investigated through data collection, observation, and hands-on activities. Experiences stimulate observation, motivate critical thinking, develop problem-solving skills, and instill confidence in students. Where age and experience-appropriate, technology such as probeware, tablets, and GPS equipment should be integrated throughout the instructional process. Experiences such as tours, gallery visits, simulations, demonstrations, or nature walks may be instructionally useful but alone do not constitute a meaningful experience. - Experiences are an integral part of the instructional program and clearly part of what is occurring concurrently in the classroom. The experience should be part of the curriculum and align with the academic standards. They should occur where and when they fit into the instructional sequence. - Experiences do not have to be based solely on scientific disciplines. They may involve materials, resources, and instruments that address multiple topics, such as maritime heritage, history, economics, civic, math, English, art, and the cultural significance of our natural resources. They should make appropriate connections between subject areas and reflect an integrated approach to learning. - Meaningful experiences are part of a sustained activity that stimulates and motivates the student from beginning to end. Though a watershed experience itself may occur as one specific event on one day, the total duration leading up to and following the experience should involve a significant investment of instructional time. Each experience should consist of three general phases: preparation; action; and reflection. Projects should provide teachers with the support, materials, resources, and information they need to conduct these three phases. \u2022 The preparation phase should focus on a question, problem, or issue and involve students in discussions about it. \u2022 The action phase should include multiple outdoor experiences sufficient to conduct the project, make the observations, or collect the data required. We strongly encourage an action phase that includes both investigation and restoration or stewardship projects that improve the environment. \u2022 The reflection phase should refocus on the question, problem, or issue; analyze the conclusions reached; evaluate the results; assess the activity and the knowledge gained; and include sharing and communication of the results. - Experiences consider the watershed as a system. MWEEs should make a direct connection to the marine or estuarine environment. Experiences do not have to be water-based activities as long as an intentional connection is made to the watershed, water quality, and the coastal and marine environment. Watershed experiences may include terrestrial activities (e.g., erosion control, buffer creation, groundwater protection, pollution monitoring or prevention). - NOAA products, services, or personnel enhance these experiences. NOAA can increase the impact of outdoor experiences with its wealth of applicable products and services, and cadre of scientific and professional experts. For example, NOAA data can supplement or contextualize the information collected by students. NOAA personnel have technical knowledge and experience that can serve to complement the classroom teacher's strengths and augment the array of resources for education. The inclusion of NOAA products and services in classroom activities will increase awareness of the agency's vast natural, informational, and data resources and may lead to better understanding of its mission. Additionally, these professionals can serve as important role models for career choices and as natural resources stewards, thus promoting STEM careers.","72629":"This federal funding opportunity meets NOAA's mission of science, service and stewardship in support of a future where societies and their ecosystems are healthy and resilient in the face of sudden or prolonged change.

Congress and the Administration want to ensure that trust between scientists and decision makers who are already working to manage climate risks is not compromised by duplicative or conflicting information. The NOAA Climate Program Office's (CPO) Regionally Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) program supports research teams that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, user-inspired, and regionally relevant research that informs resource management and public policy. The eleven RISA teams are nationally and internationally recognized for their innovations in providing support to decision makers on the ground who are managing risks associated with climate variability and change. NOAA's RISA program is a part of CPO's Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI) division and an active partner in the National Climate Data Center's (NCDC) efforts to build an integrated regional climate services partnership.Central to the RISA approach are commitments to process, partnership, and trust building; assessments of stakeholder decision-making needs and contexts; and evaluation of institutional and political constraints to using climate knowledge. RISA teams are effective because they have been able to create strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including local, regional, and state governments, federal agencies, tribal governments, utilities, the business community, national and international non-profit organizations, and educational institutions.After 15 years of regional capacity building and research, a key finding from the RISA program is that trust building between partners is best accomplished when using shared resources to collaborate on common goals, objectives or outcomes. Working together to solve problems brings people together to innovate lasting solutions. Furthermore, capacity (tools, information, knowledge, etc) is best sustained when the developers of capability or knowledge are working hand-in-hand with those entities who will apply that capability or knowledge over time. This announcement is designed to stimulate partnerships by bringing people together around specific projects related to regionally relevant issues addressing climate adaptation.
