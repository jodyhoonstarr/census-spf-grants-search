Presently, important marine habitats and living and non-living resources are neither fully explored nor characterized. OER's intent is to address these knowledge gaps and support growth in the Nation's Blue Economy by soliciting ocean exploration proposals that focus on: 1. Discovering microorganisms, sponges, corals, and other organisms with biopharmaceutical or biotechnical potential; 2. Acquiring baseline ocean environmental information to better inform decision-making where future ocean energy development or critical mineral extraction may occur; 3. Finding and characterizing shipwrecks and submerged cultural resources that played a role in America's past ocean-based economy (e.g., transport, trade, warfare, etc.) and could inform decisions on future seabed activities and potential environmental impacts. OER seeks to enhance ocean exploration and scientific knowledge of unknown or poorly known areas of the ocean through interdisciplinary exploration, and to advance and disseminate knowledge of the ocean's physical, geological, chemical, biological, and archaeological environments. This entails identifying, describing and creating baseline characterizations of new ocean habitats, marine resources and\/or processes. OER's mission is compliant with NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (http:\/\/www.performance.noaa.gov\/ngsp\/) which outlines NOAA goals of Science, Service and Stewardship. Applicants are required to submit pre-proposals and, ultimately, full proposals that support OER's exploration mission. Note: Ship time on the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer will not be funded through this announcement. Informational documents on this funding opportunity are accessible through the OER Website: https:\/\/oceanexplorer.noaa.gov\/about\/funding-opps\/welcome.html. For the purpose of this opportunity, ship time costs and\/or other ocean data collection platform support (remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, etc.) are considered rental costs and therefore are not included in Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC). ","17770":"NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration & Research (OER) seeks to enhance ocean exploration and scientific knowledge of the unknown or poorly known areas of the ocean. This entails identifying, describing and creating baseline characterizations of new ocean habitats, marine resources and\/or processes. In this Announcement, OER is seeking proposals focused on three topics including: 1. Exploration of the deep marine environments in the US EEZ and US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the Gulf of Mexico; 2. Discovery and exploration of prehistorically and historically significant submerged marine heritage sites in the Gulf of Mexico within the US EEZ and the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS); and 3. Novel or innovative technologies and methodologies that could increase the pace and scope of ocean exploration, especially exploration of deep environments including the water column and archaeological sites.For themes 1 and 2, OER will not entertain proposals outside the US EEZ and the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico. Proposals that combine more than one of these exploration topics are encouraged. All correspondence regarding this FFO must be sent to the email: oer.ffo2018@noaa.gov Applicants are required to submit pre-proposals and, ultimately, full proposals that support OER's exploration mission. OER's overarching objective is to investigate and document poorly known and unknown ocean areas through interdisciplinary exploration, and to advance and disseminate knowledge of the ocean's physical, geological, chemical, biological, and archaeological environments. OER's mission is compliant with NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (http:\/\/www.performance.noaa.gov\/ngsp\/) which outlines NOAA goals of Science, Service and Stewardship. Findings from projects and expeditions are anticipated to result in new baseline characterizations; provide better scientific understanding of the processes on US continental margins; offer new insights into climate variability and marine ecosystems; reveal new or unconventional energy, mineral, biological, and\/or archaeological resources; help identify hazards resulting from extreme events such as submarine volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis; and deliver technology advancements (platforms, sensors, methodologies, etc.) that will increase observational capabilities of the ocean. In FY18, OER anticipates availability of approximately $3,000,000 for this Funding Opportunity (this amount includes of costs for any required ship and\/or submersible assets). Note: Ship time on the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer will not be funded through this announcement. Background information on how to apply and other informational documents are accessible through the OER Office Website: http:\/\/oceanexplorer.noaa.gov\/about\/what-we-do\/funding-opportunities.html.

Federal agencies that possess the statutory authority to accept funding for this type of work may also apply and must agree to take FY2018 funding for proposed projects. Federal and state agencies are strongly encouraged to collaborate with partners from a non-federal\/non-state eligible entity. For the purpose of this opportunity, the buying of ship time and\/or other ocean data collection platform support (remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, etc.) is considered a rental cost and therefore not included in Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC). OER funding will not be provided to hire and\/or fund the salaries and associated overhead costs of any permanent federal or state government employee. OER will not pay Facilities and Administrative (F&A or \"overhead\") fees to federal and state agencies for subawards such as ship time or other ocean data collection platform support. Federal and state award recipients may use funding to cover travel, equipment, supplies, and contractual personnel costs associated with the proposed work.

The role of NOAA in these cooperative agreements is to help identify potential projects that reduce impacts of fishing on coral reef ecosystems, strengthen the development and implementation of the projects, and assist in coordination of these efforts with state, territory or commonwealth management authorities and various coral reef user groups. Approximately $1,500,000 is expected to be available for FMCCRCCA in fiscal year 2011. The NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program anticipates that awards for this competition will range from $125,000-$700,000 per a year.
