Toward this goal, the agency conducts and supports weather and climate research, oceanic and atmospheric observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision-support research, outreach, education, and partnership development. Climate variability and change present society with significant economic, health, safety, and security challenges and opportunities. In meeting these challenges, and as part of NOAA's climate portfolio within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), the Climate Program Office (CPO) advances scientific understanding, monitoring, and prediction of climate and its impacts, to enable effective decisions. These investments are key to NOAA's mission of &quot;Science, Service, and Stewardship&quot; and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies.Within this context, CPO manages competitive research programs through which NOAA funds high-priority climate science, assessments, decision support research, outreach, education, and capacity-building activities designed to advance our understanding of the Earth's climate system, and to foster the application and use of this knowledge to improve the resilience of our Nation and its partners. CPO supports research that is conducted across the United States and internationally. CPO also provides strategic guidance for the agency's climate science and services programs and supports NOAA's contributions to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and its National Climate Assessment, and similar international endeavors such as the Global Framework for Climate Services. CPO's climate research portfolio is designed to achieve a fully integrated research and applications program. We meet this objective through a focus on climate intelligence and climate resilience, in support of NOAA's goals. Climate intelligence defines CPO's technical strength through its foundational capabilities, which include (1) Observations and monitoring, (2) Research to advance scientific understanding, (3) Modeling and prediction, (4) Communication, education, and engagement, and, (5) Climate and societal interactions. A focus on climate resilience leverages CPO's climate intelligence to advance capabilities for responding to the urgent and growing demand for reliable, trusted, transparent, and timely climate information needed to sustain all sectors of our economy and environment. CPO's strategy addresses challenges in the areas of, (1) Weather and climate extremes, (2) Climate impacts on water resources, (3) Coasts and climate resilience, (4) Sustainability of marine ecosystems, and (5) Changing atmospheric composition and its impacts. Making progress in addressing climate-related societal challenges and realizing benefits for NOAA's public and private partners, requires that these mission-focused capabilities be integrated across CPO to align research, applications, transitions, and operations, and to meet the information needs of a resilient society. NOAA envisions a Nation that is prepared for, thriving, and resilient to climate variability and change. CPO's activities support a unique and highly flexible climate research enterprise to improve scientific understanding of climate variability and change and to enable businesses and communities to derive the benefits of this investment in the present and into the future. Effectively coordinating across these components through the development and deployment of end-to-end research-based integrated information systems that address needs of high societal relevance, have been hallmarks of CPO's success in linking environmental intelligence to resilience. Key components in this enterprise are annual Federal Funding Opportunities, competitive grants programs and other types of support that advance and extend NOAA's foundational capabilities and applications research. Proficiency in these core areas ensures that CPO's infrastructure is always in place to meet the intelligence and resilience challenges of our changing climate.

","14644":"EDA's mission is to lead the Federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for economic growth and success in the worldwide economy. EDA fulfills this mission through strategic investments and partnerships that create the conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life by expanding the capacity of individuals, firms, and communities to maximize the use of their talents and skills to support innovation, lower transaction costs, and responsibly produce and trade valuable goods and services. The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector. Innovation is the key to greater productivity and global competitiveness, resulting in the creation of new and better jobs, a more resilient economy and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery and advancement because regions encompass the centers of growth and competition in the new global economy. Regions achieve greater results because of the presence of diverse economic agents and, more often than not, clusters of services and industry. Quite simply, regions that work together will fare better than those that do not. Infusing more innovation and collaboration into America's regions has the potential to help communities create and retain higher-wage and sustainable jobs, leverage the flow of private capital, and strengthen America's ability to compete in the global marketplace. EDA recognizes that institutions of higher education are critical players in the development of vibrant economic ecosystems. Universities are sources of significant economic development assets-such as faculty, staff, students, research and proof of concept centers, laboratories, and high speed broadband networks-that can support regional economic growth. In addition, universities create significant knowledge spillovers and possess broader and deeper networks of expertise that can assist innovators and entrepreneurs. Research also shows that small businesses located in proximity to an institution of higher education tend to be more innovative. Potential university-based support for economic growth includes the commercialization of research, the conversion of intellectual property and ideas into products and services, and the support of regionally owned strategies that support business expansion and job creation. Additionally, universities facilitate environments conducive to trade and global exports by providing services for businesses to connect to international markets. The purpose of EDA's University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement and support regional strategies which result in job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region's innovation clusters . Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems. Since FY 2004, EDA has administered the University Center program as a competitive multi year program. As presented in the table below, EDA holds University Center program competitions in two of its six regional offices each of the following fiscal years. In FY 2017, EDA is holding the competition in its Atlanta and Seattle Regional Offices.

Recognizable climate patterns, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), emerge at the regional level where our understanding of observations and models coalesce. Critical resources for society are managed in a context of regional systems, such as water supply and human populations. Multiple scales of governance (local, state, and federal) with complex institutional relationships can be examined across a region. Climate information (i.e. data, science, research etc) developed within these contexts and working across spatial and temporal scales resonates with people making decisions on the ground.Recognizing the importance of regions and the interests of Congress, the President&apos;s Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (ICCATF) recommends that regional climate science and service efforts of the Federal government should be better coordinated to most effectively support regional-to-local decision makers facing the impacts of climate change. Congress and the Administration want to ensure that trust between scientists and decision makers who are already working to manage climate risks is not compromised by duplicative or conflicting information. The NOAA Climate Program Office&apos;s (CPO) Regionally Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) program supports research teams that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, user-inspired, and regionally relevant research that informs resource management and public policy. The eleven RISA teams are nationally and internationally recognized for their innovations in providing support to decision makers on the ground who are managing risks associated with climate variability and change. NOAA&apos;s RISA program is a part of CPO&apos;s Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI) division and an active partner in the National Climate Data Center&apos;s (NCDC) efforts to build an integrated regional climate services partnership.Central to the RISA approach are commitments to process, partnership, and trust building; assessments of stakeholder decision-making needs and contexts; and evaluation of institutional and political constraints to using climate knowledge. RISA teams are effective because they have been able to create strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including local, regional, and state governments, federal agencies, tribal governments, utilities, the business community, national and international non-profit organizations, and educational institutions.After 15 years of regional capacity building and research, a key finding from the RISA program is that trust building between partners is best accomplished when using shared resources to collaborate on common goals, objectives or outcomes. Working together to solve problems brings people together to innovate lasting solutions. Furthermore, capacity (tools, information, knowledge, etc) is best sustained when the developers of capability or knowledge are working hand-in-hand with those entities who will apply that capability or knowledge over time. This announcement is designed to stimulate partnerships by bringing people together around specific projects related to regionally relevant issues addressing climate adaptation.
