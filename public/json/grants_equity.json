By supporting exploration, i.e., discovery through disciplined, diverse observations, NOAA Ocean Exploration seeks to advance our basic understanding of waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Projects under the ocean exploration and discovery and technology themes are restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction and should support national priorities such as those in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/NOMEC_OEC_Priorities_Report.pdf) developed per the National Strategy for Mapping, Exploring, and Characterizing the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/nomec). Projects under the maritime heritage theme are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction. All projects should support at least one of NOAA's science and technology priorities of uncrewed systems, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 'omics, data, and citizen science (https:\/\/sciencecouncil.noaa.gov\/NOAA-Science-Technology-Focus-Areas). For Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) funding, NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals focused on any one of the following three themes: OCEAN EXPLORATION and DISCOVERY: Proposals should be in support of the NOAA Ocean Exploration mission to explore unknown or poorly known ocean areas, processes, and resources in waters deeper than 200 meters. Thus, NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in exploration of physical, chemical, and biological environments and processes within the oceanic water column in these deep waters. However, proposals for projects in shallower waters will be considered if they focus on exploration of tropical mesophotic environments. All proposals should be for work within waters under U.S. jurisdiction and describe how the work will address the thematic and geographic priorities for ocean exploration in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.TECHNOLOGY: Proposals should feature application of new or novel use of existing ocean technologies or innovative methods that could increase the scope and efficiency of acquiring ocean exploration data and expanding its availability and use. NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in proposals for technologies that are platform agnostic (work across multiple platforms) and\/or address novel methods (for example machine learning and artificial intelligence) to analyze existing publicly accessible large datasets. Proposed ocean technologies must be applicable to water depths of 200 meters or greater, preferably full-ocean depth (testing in shallower water or lab-based testing is acceptable), address at least one of the defined ocean exploration variables as referenced in the \"Exploration Variables Identified by NOAA Ocean Exploration\" technical memorandum (https:\/\/repository.library.noaa.gov\/view\/noaa\/29495), and describe how the work will address the thematic and geographic priorities for ocean exploration in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.MARITIME HERITAGE: Proposals should address exploration and discovery of significant maritime heritage resources that improve archaeological knowledge and inform decisions concerning preservation, management, and potential seafloor use. Maritime heritage projects can be conducted in any water depth, can focus on prehistoric and historic-period subjects, and are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Data products must benefit other academic and resource management disciplines.

California B-WET funds locally relevant, authentic experiential learning for K-12 audiences through Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences (MWEEs). MWEEs involve learning both outdoors and in the classroom as students engage in issue definition, outdoor field experiences, synthesis and conclusions, and environmental action projects. The goal is to increase understanding and stewardship of the ocean, its local watersheds, and special areas like national marine sanctuaries. Funding is available to the following counties: Del Norte, Humboldt, Trinity, Mendocino, Lake, Sonoma, Napa, Marin, Solano, San Francisco, Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Mateo, Alameda, San Joaquin, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, Stanislaus, Monterey, San Benito, Merced, Madera, Fresno, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Kings, Tulare, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The CA B-WET Program recognizes that equal and equitable access to meaningful watershed educational experiences will benefit all communities. We have a shared responsibility to provide opportunities for all youth to connect and engage with the environment; whether at a nearby park, creek, or on the shores of an ocean or lake. However, many K-12 students do not have consistent access to adequately funded, high-quality environmental experiences. And historically, youth in marginalized communities have not seen their identities reflected in nature and the environment as a whole. Therefore, the CA B-WET Program will ensure that diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of every action and every decision. We will prioritize opportunities for youth in marginalized communities to engage in the environment that surrounds them in meaningful ways. We know that to be effective stewards of our blue planet, we must ensure our programs reflect the communities in which we live, work and play. Creating a culture that is welcoming and inclusive of all, will connect students of all backgrounds to their environment and create environmentally literate decision makers.","57294":"The purpose of this notice is to solicit grant proposals from eligible state and territory Coastal Zone Management Programs (CZM Programs) for coastal habitat restoration; coastal habitat restoration planning, engineering, and design; and land conservation projects that support the goals and intent of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58.
