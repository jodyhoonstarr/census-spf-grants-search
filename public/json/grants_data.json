","61362":"NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals for ocean exploration-related projects under three themes. By supporting exploration, i.e., discovery through disciplined, diverse observations, NOAA Ocean Exploration seeks to advance our basic understanding of waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Projects under the ocean exploration and discovery and technology themes are restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction and should support national priorities such as those in the Strategic Priorities for Ocean Exploration and Characterization of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/NOMEC_OEC_Priorities_Report.pdf) developed per the National Strategy for Mapping, Exploring, and Characterizing the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (https:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/nomec). Projects under the maritime heritage theme are not restricted to waters under U.S. jurisdiction. All projects should support at least one of NOAA's science and technology priorities of uncrewed systems, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 'omics, data, and citizen science (https:\/\/sciencecouncil.noaa.gov\/NOAA-Science-Technology-Focus-Areas). For Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) funding, NOAA Ocean Exploration is soliciting proposals focused on any one of the following three themes: OCEAN EXPLORATION and DISCOVERY: Proposals should be in support of the NOAA Ocean Exploration mission to explore unknown or poorly known ocean areas, processes, and resources in waters deeper than 200 meters. Thus, NOAA Ocean Exploration is particularly interested in exploration of physical, chemical, and biological environments and processes within the oceanic water column in these deep waters. However, proposals for projects in shallower waters will be considered if they focus on exploration of tropical mesophotic environments.

","73164":"The NOAA B-WET Program is an environmental education program that supports outdoor, experiential learning through competitive grant awards in specific geographic regions. Prior to 2008, NOAA B-WET Programs were established for the Chesapeake Bay and Monterey, CA areas, and the Hawaiian Islands. In 2008 three new programs began, in New England, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Northwest. We anticipate that funds for new and continuing projects will be available under the New England B-WET program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Proposals are currently being solicited for the New England B- WET program under this funding opportunity. For the purposes of this solicitation, the New England region is defined as the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, are essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Successful projects are those carefully selected place-based experiences that are driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery, wonder, and associated stewardship impulses. B-WET projects nurture a sense of community, enable students to understand their place in their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. Experiential learning techniques, such as those supported by the NOAA B-WET Program, have been shown to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This funding opportunity supports K-12 environmental education programs that provide students with meaningful watershed education experiences (MWEEs), and provide related professional development and support to in-service teachers, administrators, or other educators serving K-12 students in New England. The Atlantic Ocean and its bays, and tidal and non-tidal rivers and tributaries are an excellent resource for environmental education. These waterbodies and the surrounding landscape provide hands-on, place-based laboratories where students can see, touch, and learn about watersheds and the greater environment. For purposes of this solicitation, MWEEs are defined as below: - Experiences are investigative or project oriented. They center around questions, problems, and issues investigated through data collection, observation, and hands-on activities. Experiences stimulate observation, motivate critical thinking, develop problem-solving skills, and instill confidence in students. Where age and experience-appropriate, technology such as probeware, tablets, and GPS equipment should be integrated throughout the instructional process. Experiences such as tours, gallery visits, simulations, demonstrations, or nature walks may be instructionally useful but alone do not constitute a meaningful experience. - Experiences are an integral part of the instructional program and clearly part of what is occurring concurrently in the classroom. The experience should be part of the curriculum and align with the academic standards. They should occur where and when they fit into the instructional sequence. - Experiences do not have to be based solely on scientific disciplines. They may involve materials, resources, and instruments that address multiple topics, such as maritime heritage, history, economics, civic, math, English, art, and the cultural significance of our natural resources. They should make appropriate connections between subject areas and reflect an integrated approach to learning. - Meaningful experiences are part of a sustained activity that stimulates and motivates the student from beginning to end. Though a watershed experience itself may occur as one specific event on one day, the total duration leading up to and following the experience should involve a significant investment of instructional time. Each experience should consist of three general phases: preparation; action; and reflection. Projects should provide teachers with the support, materials, resources, and information they need to conduct these three phases. \u2022 The preparation phase should focus on a question, problem, or issue and involve students in discussions about it. \u2022 The action phase should include multiple outdoor experiences sufficient to conduct the project, make the observations, or collect the data required. We strongly encourage an action phase that includes both investigation and restoration or stewardship projects that improve the environment. \u2022 The reflection phase should refocus on the question, problem, or issue; analyze the conclusions reached; evaluate the results; assess the activity and the knowledge gained; and include sharing and communication of the results. - Experiences consider the watershed as a system. MWEEs should make a direct connection to the marine or estuarine environment. Experiences do not have to be water-based activities as long as an intentional connection is made to the watershed, water quality, and the coastal and marine environment. Watershed experiences may include terrestrial activities (e.g., erosion control, buffer creation, groundwater protection, pollution monitoring or prevention). - NOAA products, services, or personnel enhance these experiences. NOAA can increase the impact of outdoor experiences with its wealth of applicable products and services, and cadre of scientific and professional experts. For example, NOAA data can supplement or contextualize the information collected by students. NOAA personnel have technical knowledge and experience that can serve to complement the classroom teacher's strengths and augment the array of resources for education. The inclusion of NOAA products and services in classroom activities will increase awareness of the agency's vast natural, informational, and data resources and may lead to better understanding of its mission. Additionally, these professionals can serve as important role models for career choices and as natural resources stewards, thus promoting STEM careers.","67656":"Climate variability and change present society with significant economic, health, safety, and national security challenges.

Recognizable climate patterns, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), emerge at the regional level where our understanding of observations and models coalesce. Critical resources for society are managed in a context of regional systems, such as water supply and human populations. Multiple scales of governance (local, state, and federal) with complex institutional relationships can be examined across a region. Climate information (i.e. data, science, research etc) developed within these contexts and working across spatial and temporal scales resonates with people making decisions on the ground.Recognizing the importance of regions and the interests of Congress, the President's Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (ICCATF) recommends that regional climate science and service efforts of the Federal government should be better coordinated to most effectively support regional-to-local decision makers facing the impacts of climate change. Congress and the Administration want to ensure that trust between scientists and decision makers who are already working to manage climate risks is not compromised by duplicative or conflicting information. The NOAA Climate Program Office's (CPO) Regionally Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) program supports research teams that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, user-inspired, and regionally relevant research that informs resource management and public policy. The eleven RISA teams are nationally and internationally recognized for their innovations in providing support to decision makers on the ground who are managing risks associated with climate variability and change. NOAA's RISA program is a part of CPO's Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI) division and an active partner in the National Climate Data Center's (NCDC) efforts to build an integrated regional climate services partnership.Central to the RISA approach are commitments to process, partnership, and trust building; assessments of stakeholder decision-making needs and contexts; and evaluation of institutional and political constraints to using climate knowledge. RISA teams are effective because they have been able to create strong, long-term relationships with stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including local, regional, and state governments, federal agencies, tribal governments, utilities, the business community, national and international non-profit organizations, and educational institutions.After 15 years of regional capacity building and research, a key finding from the RISA program is that trust building between partners is best accomplished when using shared resources to collaborate on common goals, objectives or outcomes. Working together to solve problems brings people together to innovate lasting solutions. Furthermore, capacity (tools, information, knowledge, etc) is best sustained when the developers of capability or knowledge are working hand-in-hand with those entities who will apply that capability or knowledge over time. This announcement is designed to stimulate partnerships by bringing people together around specific projects related to regionally relevant issues addressing climate adaptation.

NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today's variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow's. Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development. These investments are key to NOAA's mission of \"Science, Service, and Stewardship\" and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) . Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts - is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA's five-year climate objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with Federal, academic, private, and international research entities, and places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders.Within this context, NOAA's Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs conducted in regions across the United States, at national and international scales, and globally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance and oversight for the agency's climate science and services programs and helps to integrate capabilities from across the agency to provide enhanced services to its constituents.

The underlying focus of the MMPA is the implementation of policies to prevent the decline of marine mammal species beyond the point where they would stop being functioning parts of their ecosystems. The MMPA prohibits the taking of any marine mammal in U.S. waters, with the exception of certain cases such as through permitted activities, where \"take\" is defined as hunting, harassing, capturing, or killing a marine mammal or attempting to do so. The MMPA is unique in that its underlying intent is the management of marine mammal stocks to help them achieve their optimum sustainable populations within their ecosystems, rather than managing for the benefit of commercial exploitation. The MMPA was amended in 1994 to provide certain exceptions to the take prohibitions, establish provisions for the preparation of marine mammal stock assessment reports, implement a program addressing interactions between commercial fisheries and marine mammals, and institute studies of pinniped interactions with fisheries. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is charged with carrying out the mandates of the MMPA for the protection of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with protecting walruses, manatees, otters, and polar bears. The Marine Mammal Program within the NMFS Northeast Region's Protected Resources Division (PRD) carries out the mandates of the MMPA, and is charged with protecting the whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals that occur within the Northeast region (Maine through Virginia). Many of the program's activities focus on addressing human-caused impacts to marine mammals, including vessel strikes and fishing gear interactions, and managing behaviors associated with marine mammal viewing activities, such as whale watches and recreational boating. The program also includes a marine mammal health and stranding response component, which includes coordinating response and data collection efforts for stranded animals and learning more about factors affecting the health of marine mammals. Finally, an important component of the Marine Mammal Program is outreach and education efforts to support all of its sub-programs, including regulated parties like fishermen and marine mammal viewing groups like whale watch vessels. For more information about the Marine Mammal Program in the Northeast Region, visit http:\/\/www.nero.noaa.gov\/prot_res\/mmp\/. NMFS seeks the submission of proposals addressing the research and management needs that have been identified for the Marine Mammal Program in the Northeast. A wide variety of applicants are eligible to submit proposals, including state agencies, non-profit organizations, fishermen, stranding network partners, and others. This document describes how to submit proposals for funding in Fiscal Year 2011 and how NMFS will evaluate proposals and determine those that will be recommended for funding.","44791":"The NMFS is seeking to provide federal assistance, in the form of grants or cooperative agreements, to support conservation efforts for the current list of federally identified Species of Concern (SOC) under the Proactive Species Conservation Program. The program supports voluntary conservation efforts designed to conserve marine and anadromous species before they reach the point at which listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) becomes necessary. Such proactive conservation efforts can serve as an efficient, non-regulatory, and cost-effective means of managing potentially at-risk species. To raise awareness of potentially at-risk species and to foster their proactive conservation, the NMFS created a 'species of concern' list in April 2004 (69 FR 19975). 'Species of concern' are species that are potentially at risk of becoming threatened or endangered or may potentially require protections under the ESA, yet for which sufficient data are lacking. The SOC status carries no procedural or regulatory protections under the ESA. The list of SOC and descriptions of each species are available at http:\/\/www.nmfs.noaa.gov\/pr\/species\/concern\/#list. Under this solicitation, any state, territorial, tribal, or local entity that has authority to manage or regulate these species or activities that affect these species is eligible to apply to this grant program.
